# Homebound
A game about a raccoon trying to find his way back home. Made with Unity and C#.

### Overview:
Homebound is a short game about a raccoon that has been separated from their family and is searching for their way back home. Along the way, they encounter friendly NPCs that provide helpful hints, enemies that pursue the player and deal damage, and consumables that boost health. Ultimately, you must find your way out of the woodlands, overcome its challenges and reunite with your family.

The game has a low-poly aesthetic with a soft and warm colour palette. It draws inspiration from games such as "Stray" and "Firewatch" for both the look and feel.

I modelled the character/raccoon model myself in Blender for this project, along with making the texture map.
